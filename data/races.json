									"You know the {@spell Mending|XPHB} and {@spell Prestidigitation|XPHB} cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting {@spell Prestidigitation|XPHB} to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from {@spell Prestidigitation|XPHB}; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a {@variantrule Bonus Action|XPHB} to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell's ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn't do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a {@action Utilize|XPHB} action."
